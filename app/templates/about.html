  <!-- STORY -->
  <section class="section story">
    <h2>Why Shortly exists</h2>
    <p>
      We noticed that many link shorteners focused on features but forgot
      about experience. Dashboards were cluttered, actions felt heavy,
      and simple tasks took too much effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly was created to be different — thoughtful design, purposeful
      features, and a workflow that respects your time.
    </p>

  <!-- VISION -->
  <section class="section highlight">
    <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
    <p>
      Our vision is to become a calm, dependable layer between your
      content and your audience — where every link feels intentional.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe productivity tools should feel invisible, not overwhelming.
